I am part of the school of peace which is a volunteering group for teaching children. This is a website for planning and requesting data from the children. You can request where the students are living, what grade they are, when their birthday is and an optional description. Moreover it is possible to write yourself in, wether you are coming to the next date or not.

Tech stack: 
  Next.js (based on React.js) as Javascript Framework
  Bulma as CSS Framework. (I used css modules here but in future projects I would use sass)
  Mongodb as database
  
This project itself will not work because I removed my personal data (access tokens, username and password) for the mapbox api and for the database. A live demo can be found here: https://schule-des-friedens-demo.vercel.app/login
